**there's a flag you'd want to remove to spawn picom using the `xrender` backend in the `autosart` file from the `i3` and `bspwm` directories.**

configs that are here:
- i3

- sxhkd
- polybar
- yshui/picom
- rofi
- tmux

you should have installed:
- nitrogen
- dunst
- polybar

For the gruvbox GTK theme, you can use  [https://github.com/Fausto-Korpsvart/Gruvbox-GTK-Theme](this one)

just copy or symlink them into your `~/.config` directory.
